                <p>
                    I started my programming journey in 2019.
                    My husband, who is a passionate software engineer, really inspired me
                    to pursue programming. Actually, it was his awesome salary which mostly
                    motivated me ðŸ«£.</p>
                <p>I know the reason is superficial but his pay scale really
                    inspired me to pursue computer programming as a career.
                    This pursuant had been an on and off journey. I usually dont
                    count this time but I started programming  in 2017 with some
                    python book my husband suggested.  I also started the python for everybody specialization course by Charles Russell Severance on Coursera. But I think in a month, the interest eroded and I quit both of them. </p>

                <p>
                    In 2019, I left a job in online marketing and advertising and again started pursuing computer
                    programming.
                    Again, I relied on my husband to help me. I again started with books, and again, I left programming!

                </p>
                <p>
                    In mid 2020, I decided to pursue this journey through a University. I thought of getting into a good
                    university programme which could float my boat in that direction. I think my ideology at that time
                    was
                    if I
                    can't do it on my own then following a well structured system would help.
                </p>
                <p>So, I started my computer science journey from a university reference. I understood from the entrance
                    requirements that I need to brush up my math skills. This means going back to calculus and
                    precalculus,
                    which I haven't touched from the past 12 years. In hindsight, I believe that I made a huge mistake.
                    Instead
                    of focusing on learning practical skills, like HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, API's etc or in short-
                    front
                    end development, I spent my time and effort learning skills which are not directly transferable in
                    programming jobs.
                </p>
                <p>I wish I could go back in time and redo those decisions. But it is okay. No good learning and
                    knowledge
                    goes
                    bad.
                </p>
                <p>But still, I wish!
                </p>
                <p>Anyway, the last two to three years were really confusing. I knew what I was doing might be useful
                    for a
                    university curriculum, but that is just about it. Anyway I kept following the entrance requirements,
                    which
                    means taking general introductory CS courses online.
                </p>
                <p>I was preparing myself to start my programming through a University but to my utter surprise, the
                    University
                    rejected me. And I was shattered. Oh, I have been rejected twice by now lol. But the first time was
                    the
                    hardest. In my mind I was already accepted into the programme and have made lofty plans. The
                    rejection
                    was
                    really hard to accept. From that point onwards, I think from mid 2021, I decided to put all my
                    energy
                    into
                    getting accepted. It was more about getting into the programme now for me. So, I decided to take
                    credit
                    courses for Calculus. I also started the university's first year course online, which means learning
                    a
                    functional language name racket. This experience tested my grit and patience. There have been so
                    many
                    times
                    along the way where I believed programming is not for me. I can't do it. But getting into university
                    was
                    everything. So I persevere. It took a lot of time but things started connecting. Though, this entire
                    experience is not useful for jobs, but I don't know, I started enjoying programming, maybe!
                </p>
                <p>Or maybe what I was enjoying more was being busy. This learning experience also made me realize how
                    depressed
                    I was for a very long time. All this experience at least gave me goals and a daily routine to pursue
                    those
                    goals. So, it could be I was just enjoying doing something good.
                </p>
                <p>Of Course all this time spent will never contribute towards an actual job, but what I had was a
                    structure
                    or
                    routine which I unknowingly designed.
                </p>
                <p>I think somewhere in the beginning of 2022, I started having doubts again about my direction. I had
                    already
                    applied again to the university but this time, I was scared. I kept asking myself what will happen
                    if I
                    am
                    rejected again. I know I am learning computer science, but I didn't feel like taking that direction
                    anymore
                    to learn programming, mostly because it wasn't giving me useful programming skills. The pursuit of
                    getting
                    into a degree programme could be longer that I am expecting and it doesn't end afterwards. Even if I
                    get
                    into the programme, I don't know if I will get the best internship or job. This time around I had
                    been
                    really active on reddit too. I was reading posts of people who may have had the best degrees but not
                    necessarily the job they wanted. So, I was really screaming from the inside!
                </p>
                <p>From reading multiple experiences, I had understood that learning front end skills are crucial. You
                    could
                    be
                    with a degree or without degree, but these skills are most important in assessing candidates. Also,
                    thanks
                    to my husband's understanding of the industry, I knew javascript is an important language for jobs.
                    Knowing
                    what I want to learn is clear but I didn't know how to learn it. I tried books and I failed to learn
                    from
                    them. So, I knew I had to find another way to learn. </p>
                <p>For a few nights, I was sleepless. I remember digging google and frankly relied on it to help me from
                    my
                    misery. I remember reading articles about people who were following the Free Code Camp syllabus and
                    learning
                    how to program. FCC was free and easy to get onboard too. I started their syllabus and completed
                    their
                    first
                    certification. I can't explain the kind of confidence it gave me. I was sure from that point that I
                    will
                    follow their syllabus to start my front end development journey.</p>
                <p>While completing their javascript and data structures certificate, one of the best certificates in my
                    opinion, I found Scrimba. Their front end path is bible to learning front end technologies and
                    programming.
                    I am pursuing their front end path and planning to complete it. It is a great resource. I am
                    Currently
                    on
                    Module 7. Scrimba has 13 modules in the front end development path.
                </p>
                <p>Simultaneously, I have started trying my hands on leetcode, all thanks to the FCC javascript course,
                    which
                    gave me confidence to start leetcoding. I am also doing a data structure javascript course through
                    udemy
                    to
                    become better in leetcoding. This journey is slow though. I think it would take me years of
                    consistent
                    practice to really be good at solving problems.</p>
                <p>Right now I am in October of 2022. All in all, I feel that this experience is a ride I will cherish
                    always.
                    It is still a long journey but this time around I am sure of my direction (At Least for now! lol).
                    All I
                    have to do is follow it.
                </p>
                <p>Year 2022, thank you!
